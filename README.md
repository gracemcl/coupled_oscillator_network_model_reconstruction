Code to identify the model parameters from time-series for coupled oscillators.

This repository contains code from the paper Model reconstruction from temporal data for coupled oscillator networks by MJ Panaggio, M-V Ciocanel, L Lazarus, CM Topaz and B Xu.  

The file run_sweeps.py can be used to reproduce the results from the paper.  A single reconstruction can be ..
