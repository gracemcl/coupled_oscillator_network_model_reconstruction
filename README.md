# learn_network_structure
Code to identify the model parameters from time-series for coupled oscillators.

This repository contains code from the paper Model reconstruction from temporal data for coupled oscillator networks by MJ Panaggio, M-V Ciocanel, L Lazarus, CM Topaz and B Xu.  

The file run_reconstruction_sweeps.py can be used to reproduce the results from the paper.  The results for each sweep are exported to a .xls file. 

The file run_single_case.py can be used to run a single reconstruction with plots of the generated time series. 

The remaining files contain functions caleld by the scripts described above.
